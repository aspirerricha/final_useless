## Project Description
A completely useless,annoying website which will drive you crazy with the roaming buttons and overwhelming popups.

### Problem Statement 
People click things they’re told not to. What if that single act of rebellion unleashed a relentless digital roast session, glitchy torment, and total UI collapse? This project answers that question nobody asked — by combining bad design, audio abuse, and dark comedy into one gloriously useless experience.

#### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Click the wrong button and unleash a storm of savage popups, voice roasts, and glitchy chaos — all leading to a final dramatic explosion. Completely useless. Totally chaotic.
